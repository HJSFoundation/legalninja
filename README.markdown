# LegalNinja: Opensource free software for law practice management, document management, client billing, and accounting.

This application intends to fill a void in the custom app world of legal practice management.  There are several solutions out there that simply add cost for the sake of cost, and provide no easy way to switch between vendors.  This project will create a truly free, web based architecure for law firms and solo-practitioners to get work done, collaborate with clients and get paid.
